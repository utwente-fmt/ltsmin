/**
 * Leaping POR
 *
 * Using some POR search method, compute multiple independent stubborn sets and
 * schedule all their interleavings at once.
 *
 * Independent sets are found by search for disjoint stubborn sets. As
 * disjointness implies independence, by the fact that outside transitions
 * always commute with transitions inside the stubborn set.
 *
 * "Scheduling multiple interleavings at once" is done by taking the Cartesian
 * product of all disjoint sets, and atomically executing the resulting vectors
 * (i.e. not returning the intermediate steps).
