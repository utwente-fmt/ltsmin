# Unreleased - Release 3.0 of the LTSmin toolset

- Improvements to the symbolic back-end (*2lts-sym):
    - Precise counting of sets using the bignum interface. Meaning you
      can now print the size of a set arbitrarily large without loss of
      precision.
    - Add feature that allows counting the size of a set using long doubles
      (in addition to doubles). The symbolic back-end will automatically 
      switch to long doubles when necessary.
    - Add option --next-union that computes the application of a transition
      relation together with the identity.
    - The symbolic back-end is now capable of invariant checking.
    - Multiple formulas, invariants are now supported through their respective
      commandline options. If LACE is used, these properties will be checked
      in parallel.
    - It is now possible to output all Sylvan statistics, such as the size
      of the node table, number of GCs etc.
    - Add option --mu-opt that enables a faster mu-calculus model checker.
    - Sylvan's LDDmc is now the default decision diagram package.

- Improvements to the static variable ordering:
    - Invert the permutation of rows/columns (transition groups/state variables)
      using options --regroup=hf --regroup=vf respectively.
    - Transformations on the dependency matrix ignore read dependencies,
      since write dependencies seem to influence the actual size of Decision
      Diagrams to a much greater extent.
    - Add option --col-ins (see manpage) that can pick a column/state variable
      and insert it at a specific index.
    - A vast amount of static variable reordering algorithms have been added
      available through Boost and ViennaCL. Furthermore the FORCE algorithm and
      Noack's algorithms have been implemented, see [1]. In addition to these
      algorithms metrics related to the quality of the static variable order
      can be shown with option --regroup=mm.
    - A manual group/variable order can now be given with --row-perm/--col-perm
      respectively.

- Improvements to the LTSmin language (see `man ltsmin-pred`):
    - Added the enabledness operator `??` to the LTSMin language,
      see `man ltsmin-pred`.
    - Native LTSmin support for signed 32-bit integers is added,
      including some basic arithmatic operators.
    - Added a type format checker.

- A new Petri net front-end has been added to LTSmin, see [2]. The front-end
  reads Petri nets in the PNML format.

- A front-end for B, Event-B CSP, and Z is now available through ProB, see [3].

- The mCRL2 front-end now accepts files with .txt extension.

- Added support for SPOT's LTL to Buechi translation [5]

- Improvements to the multi-core backend (*2lts-mc):
    - Added a parallel Strongly Connected Components algorithm
      (--strategy=ufscc) [4].
    - Added Renault's parallel SCC algorithm (--strategy=renault).
    - Added support for transition-based general buechi automata (TGBAs)
      via UFSCC/Renault and SPOT.
    - Added Bosnacki's closed-set proviso to preserve safety under POR.
    - Support for weak LTS formulae in DFS-FIFO. Simply combine --ltl with
     --strategy=dfsfifo to benefit from this highly scalable algorithm
     (if the property is not weak, an error is raised).
    - Support for tracing in DFS-FIFO and all new SCC algorithms.

- Improvements to the PINS interface:
    - A new PINS2PINS layer is added that checks the validity of
      dependency matrices. The option --check activates the layer.
      By default, all read/write matrices are checked. When partial-order
      reduction (--por) is used, then the POR matrices are checked as well
      via an expensive reachability over the unreduced state space
      (because commutativity should hold in all futures).
    - Added experimental support for leaping partial-order reduction.
     Leap sets sequentially combine multiple disjoint POR sets to
     'leap' through the state space (--leap in combination with --por).
    - Add GBExit function that is called before a back-end exits.
    - Factored out chunk tables and other functionality from pins.c.
    - Add functions GB<set|get>VarPerm and GB<set|get>GroupPerm that allows
      language front-ends to provide permutations. This is useful when
      front-ends have language specific algorithms for static variable reordering.

- Miscellaneous:
    - All default autoconf files such as README, NEWS are moved to *.md and
      sym-linked to their old file names. The markdown styling works better with
      Github.
    - Major refactor to the PINS regrouping layer, simplifying its use for
      developers.
    - LTSmin now uses Travis CI.
    - LTSmin now fully supports the Windows platform, since CygWin is available
      in 64 bit.

   in the form of an ETF (Enumerated Table Format) file. This ETF file
   can be used as input for the reachabilty tools and can be directly
   translated to DVE.
