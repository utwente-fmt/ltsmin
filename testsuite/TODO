The test suite needs still to be extended with:

* tests for the distributed tools using --mpi, --workers and --procs.
    The distributed backend is tested in alg_backends_*, but without parallelism.
    See also the HAVE_POSIX flag in Makefile.am 
* More fine-grained dependencies. See Makefile.am, e.g. lts_generation can be
     executed partly without CADP or Mcrl2.
* Integration of src/tests/test-* binaries
