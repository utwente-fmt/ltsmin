== ProB

The ProB front-end for LTSmin uses ZMQ to communicate with ProB.
There are two ways LTSmin can communicate with ProB.
One option is to manually start ProB and specify a path to a ZMQ socket.
The other option is to add ProB to the PATH variable and let 
LTSmin start ProB. The latter option allows significant speedups through parallelism.
More information about ProB can be found at https://www3.hhu.de/stups/prob.

=== Option 1: *.probz* extension

To use this front-end with the *.probz* extension a ZMQ socket has to be opened first with ProB.
This can be done with the commandline
*LD_LIBRARY_PATH=lib ./probcli /path/to/machine.[mch|eventb|b|...] -ltsmin2 /tmp/ltsmin.probz*.
The path to the socket is given with the option *-ltsmin2*. The file extension should be *.probz*.

=== Option 2: *.mch*|*.eventb*|*.tlc* extensions

To enable parallelism the *.mch*|*.eventb*|*.tlc* extensions are used.
To use these extensions some environment variables need to be set.

  . First set the *LD_LIBRARY_PATH* variable: *export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/ProB/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH*.
  . Next set the *PATH* variable: *export PATH=/path/to/ProB:$PATH*.
  
Make sure you can run *probcli* from the commandline.
When *probcli* can be run from the commandline, then LTSmin can start multiple ProB instances to
enable parallelism.
