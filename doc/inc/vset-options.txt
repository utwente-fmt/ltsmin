=== Vector Set Options

*--vset*='TYPE'::
        Select type of vector set: 'ldd64', 'ldd', 'list', 'tree', 'fdd', 'ddd', 'sylvan', or 'lddmc'.
        With 'ldd64', the 64-bit ListDD list encoding is used (non-ATerm based).
        With 'ldd', the 32-bit ListDD list encoding is used (non-ATerm based).
        With 'list', ATermDD with list encoding is used.
        With 'tree', ATermDD with tree encoding is used.
        With 'fdd', BuDDy FDDs are used.
        With 'ddd', libDDD SDDs are used.
        With 'sylvan', the parallel BDD package Sylvan is used.
        With 'lddmc', the parallel LDD package LDDmc is used.
        Defaults to first available type in the list.
*vset-cache-diff*='diff'::
        Influences the size of operations cache when counting precisely with bignums: 
        cache size = floor((2log('nodes-to-count') + <diff>)^2). More precisely; LTSmin
        will bitshift <diff> bits to the left or right on the number of nodes in the vector set,
        depending on the signedness of <diff>. The default is *0*, meaning that if
        the cache is full the number of bignums in memory will be equal to the number of nodes
        in the vector set. The default value seems to work well, even when the number vectors
        in the vector set is very large relative to the number of nodes. If the number of vectors
        relative to the number of nodes is lower, <diff> may be decreased. The user may want to
        set <diff> as low as possible (to save memory), while keeping the operations cache effective.
        Bignums are not floating point numbers and may thus consume a lot of memory.
