*--order*='ORDER'::
        Select the exploration strategy: 'bfs-prev', 'bfs', 'chain-prev',
        or 'chain'. With 'bfs-prev' and 'bfs', breadth-first search is
        used. Here, 'bfs-prev' only considers the states found at the
        previous level, while 'bfs' considers the whole visited set. With
        'chain-prev' and 'chain', a chaining strategy is used. Here,
        'chain-prev' at each level starts from the states found at the
        previous level, while 'chain' uses the whole visited set. Defaults
        to 'bfs-prev'.
+
When using breadth-first search, the tool performs the next state computation
for all edge groups on the current level or current set of visited states.
Chaining means to apply next state for the first group to the visited
states, then apply next-state for the second group to the result,
etc.  Thus, a chaining analysis can be completed in much less
iterations than a BFS analysis.

*--saturation*='SATURATION'::
        Select a saturation strategy: 'none', 'sat-like', 'sat-loop', 'sat-fix',
        'sat'. The 'sat-like' strategy goes up and down the levels of the BDD
        used to represent the state space. The 'sat-loop' strategy loops over
        the levels. The 'sat-fix' strategy repeatedly performs a fixpoint
        computation using saturation. The 'sat' strategy does saturation as
        described in the literature with on-the-fly expansion of the transition
        relations. Defaults to 'none', i.e. no saturation.
+
All strategies except 'sat-fix' and 'sat' work in combination with the 'order'
to saturate levels.

*--sat-granularity*='GRANULARITY'::
        Select the granularity of 'sat-like' and 'sat-loop' strategies. The
        granularity indicates how many BDD levels are considered at the same
        time. Defaults to 10.

*--save-sat-levels*::
        Save the previous states seen at saturation levels. This option has
        effect for any of the saturation strategies in combination with either
        'bfs-prev' or 'chain-prev'.

*--action*='ACTION'::
        Find a transition labelled with 'ACTION'. Returns with exit code 1
        if such a transition is found, otherwise 0.

*--mu*='MUFILE'::
    After computing all reachable states, evaluate the mu-formula in 'MUFILE'
+
'MUFILE' is a file containing a Mu Calculus formula (see
manpage:ltsmin-mu[5]). This formula is a propositional formula with
least and greatest fixpoint operator. It will be evaluated after generation
of the complete state space.

*--ctl**='CTLFILE'::
    Convert a ctl* formula given in 'CTLFILE' (see manpage:ltsmin-ctl[5]) to
    a mu-formula (see manpage:ltsmin-mu[5]), and evaluate the mu-formula after
    computing all reachable states.
