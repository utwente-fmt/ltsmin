=== PNML Options

*--noack*='1|2'::
        Set the Noack order to apply.

*--edge-label*='id|name'::
        Set what to use as edge label. This only affects Petri nets written in
        PNML, not those written in e.g. ANDL. When value 'id' is given, the 
        transition identifier will be used as edge label. When value 'name' is
        given the transition's name will be used as edge label. This mostly
        affects how atomic propositions are interpreted.
