=== PINS Options

*--labels*::
        Print state variable, type and value names, and state and action labels.
        Then exit.
        Useful for writing predicate (+--invariant+), LTL (+--ltl+),
        CTL/CTL* (+--ctl+), and mu-calculus (+--mu+) expressions.

*--matrix*::
        Print the dependency matrix and exit.

*-c*, *--cache*::
    Enable caching of greybox calls.
+
If this option is used, the state space generator makes calls to the
short version of the greybox next-state function and memoizes the
results. If the next-state function is expensive this will yield
substantial speedups.

*--pins-guards*::
    Use guards in combination with the long next-state function to speed up the next-state function.

*--allow-undefined-edges*::
    Allow values for edge variables in atomic predicates to be unreachable.

*--allow-undefined-values*::
    Allow undefined values in atomic predicates for enums.

*-r*, *--regroup*='SPEC'::
    Enable regrouping optimizations on the dependency matrix.
+
'SPEC' is a comma-separated sequence of transformations
'<(_T_,)+>' which are applied in this order to the
dependency matrix.  The following transformations _T_ are available:

*--row-perm*='PERM'::
    Apply row permutation 'PERM', where 'PERM' is a sequence of row numbers, separated by a comma.
    E.g. the vector 2,1,0 will swap row 2 with row 0.
    
*--col-perm*='PERM'::
    Apply column permutation 'PERM', where 'PERM' is a sequence of column numbers, separated by a comma.
    E.g. the vector 2,1,0 will swap column 2 with column 0.
    
*--col-ins*='PAIRS'::
    Insert columns before other columns in the dependency matrix.
+
'PAIRS' is a comma-separated sequence of pairs '<(C.C',)+>'.
E.g. *--col-ins=1.0* will insert column *1* before column *0*.
Each pair contains a source column *C* and a target column *C'*. During the application of the whole
sequence, *C* will always be the column number that corresponds with the column before the application of the whole sequence.
The column number *C'* will always be the column during the application of the whole sequence. This means that
in for example *--col-ins=2.0,1.0*, first column *2* is inserted at position *0*, then column *1* is inserted at position *0*.
The result will be that the original column *2* will be at position *1*.
Another important detail is that when *--col-ins* is used, all source columns will temporarily be "removed"
during reordering from the dependency matrix, i.e. when the *-r*,*--regroup* option is given. After reordering
is done, the columns will be inserted at the desired target position. In other words, reordering algorithms
given by the option *-r*,*--regroup*, will only be applied on the dependency matrix with source columns removed.
+

*--sloan-w1*='WEIGHT1'::
    Use 'WEIGHT1' as the first weight for the Sloan algorithm, see https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/libs/graph/doc/sloan_ordering.htm.

*--sloan-w2*='WEIGHT2'::
    Use 'WEIGHT2' as the second weight for the Sloan algorithm, see https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/libs/graph/doc/sloan_ordering.htm.

*--graph-metrics*::
    Print Boost's and ViennaCL's graph metrics (only available when LTSmin is compiled with Boost or ViennaCL).
    
*--regroup-exit*::
    Exit with 0 when regrouping is done.

*--regroup-time*::
    Print timing information of each transformation, given in sequence *--regroup* (*-r*).

*--mucalc*='FILE'|'FORMULA'::
    Compute a parity game for the mu-calculus formula.
+
The mu-calculus formula is provided in the file 'FILE' or directly
as a string 'FORMULA'. The syntax and tool support are described in 
manpage:ltsmin-mucalc[5].

ifdef::ltl[]
*--ltl*='LTLFILE|LTLFORMULA'::
    Compute cross-product of a Buchi automaton and the specification
+
'LTLFILE' is a file containing an Linear Temporal Logic formula (see
manpage:ltsmin-ltl[5]).  Which content can also be provided directly as
'LTLFORMULA'.  This formula will be converted to a Buchi
automaton.  Then the synchronous cross product with the original
specification is computed on-the-fly.  A state label is added to
encode accepting states.

*--ltl-semantics*='spin|textbook|ltsmin'::
    Change the semantics of the crossproduct generated using '--ltl'
+
Three options are available, the default is automatically chosen based on the
atomic predicates in the formula.

spin;;
    Use semantics equal to the spin model checker. From the 'source'
    state all transitions are generated. Then, state predicates
    are evaluated on the 'source' state. The Buchi automaton now
    moves according to these predicates.
    Deadlocks in the LTS cause the Buchi to progress independently.
    This option is incompatible with edge-based atomic predicates.
    This option is the default if no edge-based atomic predicates are found
    in the LTL formula.

textbook;;
    Use textbook semantics. A new initial state is generated with an
    outgoing transition to the initial state. Now, predicates
    are evaluated on the 'target' state and the Buchi automaton
    moves according to these predicates.
    Deadlocks in the LTS do NOT cause the Buchi to progress independently.
    This option is incompatible with edge-based atomic predicates.

ltsmin;;
    Same as spin semantics, but now deadlocks in the LTS do NOT cause the Buchi
    to progress independently.
    This option is the default if edge-based atomic predicates are found
    in the LTL formula or when a monitor is built.

*--buchi-type*='ba|spotba|tgba|monitor'::
    Select the type of Buchi automaton to build to crossproduct with.
+
Four options are available; the default is 'ba'.

ba;;
    Use the Buchi automaton created by ltl2ba.

spotba;;
    Use the Buchi automaton created by Spot.

tgba;;
    Use the Transition-based Generalized Buchi Automaton created by Spot.

monitor;;
    Use the monitor created by Spot. When a monitor is created, LTSmin will
    compute the crossproduct with this monitor. Every *finite* trace in the
    crossproduct leading to the rejecting state in the monitor is a violation of
    the LTL formula. LTSmin will warn the user when the LTL formula is not a
    safety property. For more information about monitors see:
    https://spot.lrde.epita.fr/tut11.html.
endif::ltl[]

*--por*='heur|del'::
    Activate partial-order reduction
+
Partial-Order Reduction (POR) can reduce the state space when searching
for deadlocks (+-d+) or accepting cycles (+--ltl+).
Two POR algorithms are available:

heur;;
    Uses a cost-based heuristic beam-search to find the smallest stubborn set

del;;
    Uses Valmari's deletion algorithm to find the smallest stubborn set by
    iteratively removing transitions while maintaining the constraints. 


*--weak*::
    Use weak commutativity in partial-order reduction. Possibly yielding better
    reductions.
    
 
*--leap*::
    Use leaping partial-order reduction, by combining several disjoint
    stubborn sets sequentially.
