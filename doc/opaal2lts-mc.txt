== NAME

opaal2lts-mc - Concurrent state space generator for UPPAAL timed automata
[uppaal] models via the successor generator opaal [opaal].

== SYNOPSIS

*{manname}* [OPTION]... 'input'<_.so|_.xml>

== DESCRIPTION

{manname} performs multi-core reachability on the labelled transition system
from a compiled specification provided in 'input.xml' or 'intput.so' (precompiled).

opaal-ltsmin-succgen[opaal] is an open source implementation of the
UPPAAL model checker. It was extended to generate successor generators for
the LTSmin PINS interface. Therefore the PINS interface was extended to
support the semi-symbolic states in timed automata.
For more details on the multi-core timed-automata implementation, refer
