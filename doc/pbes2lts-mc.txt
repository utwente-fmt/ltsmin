== NAME

pbes2lts-mc - Concurrent state space generator for PBES models.

== SYNOPSIS

*{manname}* [OPTION]... 'input.pbes'

== DESCRIPTION

{manname} performs multi-core reachability and LTL model checking on the
labelled transition system from a compiled
specification provided in 'input.pbes'.  Specifications are in _pbes_ format
and are commonly generated by manpage:lps2pbes[1].
Because the pbes depends on libraries that are not thread-safe, this tool
uses processes instead of threads (*--procs*).
LTS output is not supported by this tool, use the distributed tools instead.
