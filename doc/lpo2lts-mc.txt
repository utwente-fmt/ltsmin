== NAME

lpo2lts-mc - Concurrent state space generator for mCRL models.

== SYNOPSIS

*{manname}* [OPTION]... 'input'_.tbf_

== DESCRIPTION

{manname} performs multi-core reachability and LTL model checking on the
labelled transition system from a compiled
specification provided in 'input.tbf'. Specifications are in _tbf_ format
and are commonly generated by manpage:mcrl[1] or manpage:mcrl22mcrl[1].  
Because the tbf depends on libraries that are not thread-safe, this tool
uses processes instead of threads (*--procs*).
LTS output is not supported by this tool, use the distributed tools instead.
